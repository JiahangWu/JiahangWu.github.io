Currently, I am a Research Fellow at [Event Driven Perception for Robotics](https://edpr.iit.it/) at [Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia](https://www.iit.it/), working with [Dr. Chiara Bartolozzi](https://edpr.iit.it/people-details/-/people/chiara-bartolozzi) and [Dr. Arren Glover](https://arrenglover.github.io/).  I obtained M.Sc degrees from King's College London in 2022, and my B.Sc degree from Capital University of Economics and Business.

<!-- Previously, I was also an visiting student at [the Mobile Perception Lab](https://mpl.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) at ShanghaiTech University from October 2022 to October 2023, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. [Laurent Kneip](https://mpl.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/Director.html). -->

My research interests lie in computer vision and robotics, especially using event cameras. Currently, I am working on event-based motion estimation and environment understanding. My research objective is to develop algorithms that shift traditional visual paradigms toward the great potential of event cameras, including HDR, low latency, high temporal resolution, etc.
